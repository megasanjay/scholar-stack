## Getting Started

### 1. Installing dependencies

you can install its dependencies with any tools which you use, but inside the project I used yarn for pre-commit commands.
so better to use yarn.

```bash
npm install
 or
yarn
 or
pnpm install
```

### 2. run the dev server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
 or
yarn dev
 or
pnpm dev
```
